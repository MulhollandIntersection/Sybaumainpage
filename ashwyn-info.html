            <h2>Basic Information</h2>
            <p>Ashwyn is just a regular boy in Ansci, passing Grade 7 to 8 with flying colors. He is in Grade 9 now, in the section Archimedes. He is most very known for fathering the  study of Sybauology, which has improved the cultural and lingustical structure of the Sybau friend group. Many known members of the group are his own friends, which were all in on the idea.</p>
            <h2>Birth of Sybauology</h2>
            <p>One day, during brigada day in which we clean our school, it sparked to him an idea: "What if we made a group for our friends, by our friends?". But this was too generalistic and common of an idea, so he also said "What if we had our own language, so that only we can understand ourselves?" That day, Sybaulogy was born. He invited his prior existing friend group on the idea, and they approved. That's why the five secondary Sybaulogians are his own friends.</p>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Ashwyn's legacy lives on through the continued study and practice of Sybauology among his friends and peers. The group has grown and evolved, but the core principles of friendship, understanding, and creativity remain at its heart. (Copilot AI generated suggested text)</p>
