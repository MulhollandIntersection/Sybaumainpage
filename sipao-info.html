            <h2>Basic Information</h2>
            <p>Earl Matthew O. Sipao was just any other regular boy in Ansci. But one day, while he was in Grade 7, tragedy struck. He got hit by a motorcycle and his bones got broken and had metal installed. Despite hardships, Sipao muddled through the swamps and mangroves of life. But, Sipao, unlike the other people of this group, academically struggled. But should grades be the final measurement? Sipao had another genius, and he shared this genius with Deshmukh. </p>
            <h2>Birth of Sybauology</h2>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Ashwyn wasn't really the first one to come up with Sybauology. It was Sipao.ã€€He referenced, he spoke, and almost seemed to prophesy about a future study like this one. Everyone thought he was crazy to think of such a thing, but, they were all wrong. A year later, Ashwyn rediscovered these sayings, revised it, and gave life to what we know today as Sybauology.</p>
            <h2>Forgotten and Reinstated</h2>
            <p>As Sybauology grew, Sipao was forgotten, and Ashwyn took the spotlight. People forgot about him because he was not at the time of it flourishing, and he was erased from the minds of the people. When Sybauology was taught, he was omitted, seeing him as "unimportant" and "irrelevant". It was only a couple of months later that he was recognized of his place, after people realized who Deshmukh took inspiration from. Now, people rightly crown him "Father of Sybauology, the one before Ashwyn, he who spoke it all".</p>
