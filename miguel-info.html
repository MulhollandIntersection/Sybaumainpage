            <h2>Basic Information</h2>
            <p>Miguel is like any other of the smarter students of Ansci, resourceful and intelligent with what little he has. But, like many members of Sybau group, he ofcourse had to have humor within himself. As he caught on to lessons, he also caught up to modern humor.</p>
            <h2>Invitation to Sybauology</h2>
            <p>The friendship between Miguel and Ashwyn existed way before the existence of Sybauology, often being cited as one of the founders of Sybau group. As Ashwyn first synthesized the study of Sybauology, he invited Miguel, and he accepted.</p>
            <h2>Birth of Gurtology</h2>
            <p>As Sybauology evolved, so did Miguel's ideas. But as he stayed longer within the field of Sybauology, he found larger problems within it that Ashwyn didn't know how to work on, one of the largest being, ethics. So, he developed Gurtology as a way to expand on this, and to improve the study of Sybauology to make it safe, and to keep the culture of the study itself safe, so as not to mix itself with the crowd of already existing ones.</p>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Miguel's legacy in Sybauology is marked by his contributions to the understanding of the language and its cultural significance. His work of Gurtology inspired others and broke their chains of misunderstanding, allowing for a more nuanced appreciation of Sybauology and its applications. It made them less scared to join the field, allowing for the futher development of Sybauology.</p>
